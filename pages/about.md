I was always an engineer at heart and had been lucky enough to drop into the doorstep of the thing that I had been trying to find ever since I was young. From an early age, I was definitely interested in building things. I’ve always been fascinated by intricate parts to blinking lights on electronics and now, I aspire to bring these imaginations into reality. It all began when my parents bought a 1,000 piece Lego set. I would always build figures or robots that would battle each other. This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. Building, anything, had this lure to them that further fueled my curiosity. 

I was then exposed to the computer. This baffling machine was unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. When my dad’s 1999 Dell computer broke down, I had the greatest joy of dissembling the computer to inspect each intricate part. Later on when I got old enough and was given my own computer, this curiosity continued to take its course. Although I couldn't really create anything yet, I sure could mess around with the operating system and install generous amounts of software to satisfy my curiosity. From my childhood experiences and my introduction to electronics, my dream is to be a part of the computer world.

Throughout high school I faced obstacles which have altered my view of the world. From my peers I realized that there were always brighter people in the world and instead of trying to beat them; I should learn from them. This prompted me to join various organizations where I was an Treasurer in Key Club, a officer in Math Team and at one point the chair of the student council committee. These positions helped satisfy my need to create something: organizations at their core are functional systems which serve to fulfill some purpose; similarly to how each engineer is essential to a specific part of a project.

Naturally, with my interest in computers and with my desire to create, my career choice gravitated towards Computer Engineering. Although it didn't happen immediately, I eventually got the sense that this was what I was looking for. When I come to think if it, technology has changed so fast over the years, and through my childhood experiences, I now strive to become a part of it. So here I am now, a computer engineering student, an electronics hobbyist, an aspiring software developer and still a builder of things.
